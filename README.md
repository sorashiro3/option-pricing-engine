# Option Pricing Engine

A high-performance simulator for pricing European call options using both **Black-Scholes** and **Monte Carlo** models‚Äîdesigned for real-time, low-latency environments.

---

## Overview

This project implements:

- üìà **Black-Scholes Analytical Model**  
- üé≤ **Monte Carlo Simulation with Antithetic Variates**  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **OpenMP-Based Parallelization** for fast, scalable simulation  
- üìä **Performance Benchmarking** and convergence analysis
